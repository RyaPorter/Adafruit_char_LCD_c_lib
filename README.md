# Adafruit_char_LCD_c_lib
The standard Adafruit CharLCD library translated into c for the Rpi Pico. The original (deprecated) python library can be found (here)[https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD/blob/master/Adafruit_CharLCD/Adafruit_CharLCD.py]

Bit's of the library have been omitted as I had no need for them, namely RGB and backlight control.

I wired the pins RS, EN, D4, D5, D6, D7 to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. These can be changed in the header definitions.
